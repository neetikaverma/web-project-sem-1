        <h4>Q. If a employee refuses to wear a mask must they be turned away or be refused service?</h4>
        <p>Yes, if the business is not able to provide a mask, the business should consider providing information on mask making, <br>
             distributing “how to” flyers, or sharing information about where masks can be purchased.<br>
              Additionally, we advice everyone that masks are required; <br>
             If a customer/employee is belligerent or aggressive, there is no expectation that <br>
             an employee should provide the service or customer should take the service and themselves in a dangerous situation.</p>
        <h4>Q. How can I hire best packers and movers at affordable rates?</h4>
        <div>There are certain ways through which you can hire a dependable and experienced moving company for your upcoming move
            
                1. Check their strength of crew and vehicles<br>
                2. Read reviews and check rating<br>
                3. Read the contract thoroughly before signing it, and finalizing the service.<br>
                3. Check their credulity and authenticity.<br>
           
          </div>
        <h4>Q. What is in our drinking water?</h4>
        <p>Drinking water, like every other substance, contains small amounts of bacteria.<br>
             Most of these bacteria are common ones and they are generally not harmful. 
             Chlorine is usually added to drinking water to prevent bacterial growth while the water streams through pipelines.
             This is why drinking water also contains minimal amounts of chlorine.</p>

       <h4>Q. Do independent experts research and evaluate cosmetic safety?</h4>
        <p>
            The CIR thoroughly reviews and assesses the safety of ingredients used in cosmetics in an open, unbiased, <br>
            and expert manner and publishes the results of its work in peer-reviewed scientific literature. <br>
            FDA, CFA and the Personal Care Products Council provide non-voting liaisons to the Panel and are 
            actively involved in the comment and discussion process.</p>
        
        <h4>Q. How long will the repairs take?</h4>
        <p>The repair time will depend on the extent of the product damage. Once the the professional reach your house, <br>
            they will produce an repair estimate and contact you within 2-3 hours to discuss it with you.</p>
